FINAL CAPSTONE PROJECT OF THE DATA ENGINEERING BOOTCAMP
======================================================

Motor Vehicle Collisions - Crashes in the City of New York
which is a real-time dataset updated daily, and which was
made available to the public since 5/7/2014.
That is provided by the Police Department of New York (NYPD)
======= SOME OF USE CASES TO ANSWER WITH THIS DATASET=====
A- the city authorities and NYPD should start implementing changes in at least these extremely risky areas in NYC.
B- Additionally, there should be better reporting of the cause of accidents so measures can be taken accordingly
C- A process should be set up to obtain a detailed report on the cause of the accident from insurance companies
D - Finally, decisions that helped bring the counts of collisions down in 2019 should be further pursued.

Data analysis by borough

1- Number of collisions by years for each borough(borough by year)
2- Number of collisions by month for each borough (borough by month)
3- Number of collisions by day of the week for each borough (daily)
4- Number of collisions in half of the hour intervals for each borough
5- the percentage of people killed by year and borough
6- the percentage of people injured by year and borough
7- the percentage of accidents by causal factors in Manhattan

---

1- What are the top five most frequent contributing factors for
accidents in NYC?
2- What percentage of accidents had alcohol as a contributing factor?
3- What time of day sees the most cyclist injuries or deaths caused by a motor vehicle collision?
4- Which zip code had the largest number of nonfatal and fatal
accidents?
5- Which vehicle make, model, and year was involved in the most
accidents?
6- How does the number of collisions in an area of NYC correlate to the number of trees in the area?
7-

PROJECT: BUILD A DATA PIPELINE TO INGEST THE NEW YORK POLICE DEPARTEMENT (NPDY) MOTOR VEHICLE COLISIONS AND CRASHES data.
the data is updated daily
=========================

A- Objective of the project (What would you like people to do with the data you have produced?)
B- Consumers of your data (What users would find your dataset useful?)
c- Selected Dataset (What datasets are you sourcing from?)
D- Solution architecture (How does data flow from source to serving?)
E- Breakdown of tasks (How is your project broken down? Who is doing what?)
===========================================================================

CREATE DIFFERENT GIT BRANCHES TO MANAGE MY PROJECT
A- Branch_1 name : DATA_INGESTION
B- Branch_2 name :
C- Branch_3 Name :
==================

ETL = EXTRACT - TRANSFORM - LOAD
EXTRACT Data from the NYPD Motor vehicles collision dataset API
TRANSFORM the data obtained from the NYPD dataset
LOAD the transformed data to a data warehouse

---

ELT = EXTRACT - LOAD - TRANSFORM
EXTRACT Data from the NYPD Motor Vehicles collision dataset through its API
LOAD it into the Data warehouse where it will be transformed

=======================================================
1- Setting up the virtual environment ==>> Done
2-

=======================================================
A- DATA INGESTION
=================

A- Source of Data
B- Ingestion
C- Storage
D- Serving
==========

Based on your data engineering project requirements, you can perform the following high-level tasks:
A- Collect the data.
B- Cleanse the data
C- Transform the data.
D- Process the data.
E- Monitor jobs.
